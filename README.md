## Data Structure Diagrams
The following three diagrams are referenced in the code and included to help explain how the data structure used in the API is constructed. In the *Triangle vertex first row* diagram we can see the first row of the grid and the triangles used. *BCA Pattern* expands on *Triangle vertex first row* by including the coordinates of the vertex that must be moved to complete the given triangle. Vertexâ€™s that do not move are marked with double double quotes "","". In *BCA Pattern* starting at F2 for B, F3 for A and F4 for C another pattern emerges that *AXY Pattern* is visualizing. *AXY Pattern* visualizes a pattern where X and Y are increased by 10 then the vertex does not move for two triangles but on the third the X increases by 20 and the Y remains at the base value for Y in the current row. In the case for the F row Y returns to 0 and for the E row Y is 10 etc..
